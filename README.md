## Problem statement:
Write a MIPS assembly program which performs a pairwise swap of the elements of a 32bit array of as follows: 
a[0] <-> a[size/2], a[1] <-> a[size/2+1], ... with *size* being the number of elements of the array.
 
## Files to work on
* `lab02.asm` 
* `README.md` to add your name<br/>
* You may optionally change `Lab02Test.java` to add more test inputs.<br/>
Please **DO NOT MODIFY** any other files. 
      
## Running 
* To run the program interactively, start MARS: `java -jar MarsMYY505_4_5.jar`, and load the .asm file
* To run the test using munit: <br/>
```
    javac -cp munit.jar Lab02Test.java
    java -jar munit.jar lab02.asm Lab02Test.class
```

## Automatic testing 
Every commit pushed is automatically tested, by running the above commands on a virtual machine.
To view the test results, click on the "Actions" tab and you will see the list of commits.
Next to each commit there will be a red x if the test fails, or a green tick, if it passes. Click on a commit name and then "Autograding", on the left. You can then expand the logs (little ">"s in the dark area of the window) to view the error messages.
